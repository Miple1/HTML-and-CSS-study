            <p class="topic">he unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity 
                as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead.
                In European literature and art, the unicorn has for the last thousand years or so been depicted
                as a white horse-like or goat-like animal with a long straight horn with spiralling grooves,
                cloven hooves, and sometimes a goat's beard. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance,
                it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace,
                which could be captured only by a virgin. In encyclopedias,
                its horn was described as having the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness.
                In medieval and Renaissance times, the tusk of the narwhal was sometimes sold as a unicorn horn.
